# Doing the Balloons In-House
The above suppliers have some good options for balloons, however i would strongly recommend considering doing some of the ballooning in-house. 
For example, a balloon arch would cost us approximately £30 to produce, and is not as hard as it sounds. We can produce 10 balloon clusters for £30, whilst it would take £150 for the same number from Kelly. 
If you don't like the idea of balloons being done in house, a solution could be to get Kelly to produce large items, such as the balloon arches, and we put together small items such as balloon clusters. 
I would strongly recommend considering doing the balloons ourselves based on the quotes.
