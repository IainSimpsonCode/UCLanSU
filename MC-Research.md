# Mitigating Circumstances

## Industry Research

### University of Chester
The MC process at Chester has been replaced by a system of Extentions and Deferrals. Chester students can apply for any of the 3 following options:
- Extention
- Deferral
- Waiving of Late Work Penalty

#### Extentions
Students can recieve extentions for thier assignments for either up to 7-days, or 8 days or more. For an extention of up to 7-days, students can self-certify without having to supply evidence.[^1][^2]
Unlike the academic appeals process, extentions are handled at the academic department level, and students are not required to submit a form for a 7-day extention. Students requiring an extention of longer than 7 days must complete an online application system and provide evidence on that form. [^1]

#### Deferrals
Deferrals are a way for students to postpone thier assignment to the next assessment period. Similar to extentions, deferrals are handled by the academic departments. However, unlike extentions, deferrals always require evidence and must be submitted via an online application system. [^1]
Although you can submit for a deferral after the deadline of your coursework/exam, if your application is sucessful, you will forfiet the mark you would have been awarded. [^2]

#### Waiving of the Late Work Penalty
Students can follow the same system as the aforementioned deferrals to request the late work penalty be waived. These requests must be made through an online application and must have supporting evidence. If approved, any penalty or submitting work late will be removed and full marks will be reinstated[^1]

#### Evaluation
Although on the surface, the system of Extentions and Deferrals is more flexible and more student focused, it lacks transparency and information. From publicly accessible resources, I can't find any information on what evidence is considered suitable and what situations would be acceptable for extentions to be considered. 
Depsite this, it is clear that the system in place at Chester is more focused on student accessibility and ease of use for students.

### University of Cumbria
Mitigating Circumstances at Cumbria are defined as Extenuating Circumstances (EC). These are clearly definined in Appendix 3e of the University of Cumbria Academic Procedures and Processes. [^3]
