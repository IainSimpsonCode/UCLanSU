# Mitigating Circumstances
The following is research into the mitigating circumstances (MC) process across different institutions across the sector. 
The following report looks into 3 different areas:
- What systems are in place for students to apply for mitigating circumstances and/or extentions
- The transparency of the systems in place
- The ease-of-use for students

## Keywords
- Mitigating Circumstances (MC)
- Extenuating Circumstances (EC)
- Extentions
- Deferrals

## Industry Research

### University of Chester
The MC process at Chester has been replaced by a system of Extentions and Deferrals. Chester students can apply for any of the 3 following options:
- Extention
- Deferral
- Waiving of Late Work Penalty

#### Extentions
Students can recieve extentions for thier assignments for either up to 7-days, or 8 days or more. For an extention of up to 7-days, students can self-certify without having to supply evidence.[^1][^2]
Unlike the academic appeals process, extentions are handled at the academic department level, and students are not required to submit a form for a 7-day extention. Students requiring an extention of longer than 7 days must complete an online application system and provide evidence on that form. [^1]

#### Deferrals
Deferrals are a way for students to postpone thier assignment to the next assessment period. Similar to extentions, deferrals are handled by the academic departments. However, unlike extentions, deferrals always require evidence and must be submitted via an online application system. [^1]
Although you can submit for a deferral after the deadline of your coursework/exam, if your application is sucessful, you will forfiet the mark you would have been awarded. [^2]

#### Waiving of the Late Work Penalty
Students can follow the same system as the aforementioned deferrals to request the late work penalty be waived. These requests must be made through an online application and must have supporting evidence. If approved, any penalty or submitting work late will be removed and full marks will be reinstated. [^1]

#### Evaluation
Although on the surface, the system of Extentions and Deferrals is more flexible and more student focused, it lacks transparency and information. From publicly accessible resources, I can't find any information on what evidence is considered suitable and what situations would be acceptable for extentions to be considered. 
Depsite this, it is clear that the system in place at Chester is more focused on student accessibility and ease of use for students.

##### Best Elements
- More options available to students
- Clearer wording/naming

### University of Cumbria
Mitigating Circumstances at Cumbria are defined as Extenuating Circumstances (EC). These are clearly definined in Appendix 3e of the University of Cumbria Academic Procedures and Processes. [^3]
Students may also apply for extentions as defined in Appendix 3c. [^4]

#### Extenuating Circumstances
Students may submit a form [^9], with evidence, to apply for extenuating circumstances on an assessment. If sucessful, the academic board may void the assessment, meaning the student can retake the assessment, or, if the extenuating circumstance affects more than 40 credits worth of assessments, they will create an academic contract with new requirements and dates for completion for assessments. [^5][^10]

#### Extentions
While extenuating circumstances won't provide students with more time to complete thier assessment, they can seperately apply for an extention. Students may be granted an extention of up to 2 weeks, or more in exceptional circumstances. However, an extention cannot extend past the module confirmation boards. [^6] 
For an extention, students must complete a form with a reason for the extention. [^7] Students don't need to supply evidence for an extention, however may need to if they are requesting an extention of more than 2 weeks. Once completed, students send the form to the course team, who then approve the extention and forward the extention request to the Programme Administration Team. [^8] Extentions are granted at the discretion of the course team, however, appendix 3e states that extention approvals and extention length must be consistant across the course. [^6]

#### Evaluation
While the system in place at Cumbria provides less options for students, they system itself is more transparent than Chester's. Appendix 3e clearly outlines what is a valid and invalid reason for extenuating circumstances, and appendix 3c clearly outlines the process for extentions. 
The one major downside, is that the process is less student-friendly. To understand the process, students are required to read long documents filled with jargon. It is clear that the form and process was designed with the administrators in mind, rather than the students in mind.

##### Best Elements
- Clearer process
- More streamlined
- Well documented

### University of Manchester
University of Manchester provides mitigating circumstances and extentions to students. The rules for these can be found in the following documents:
- [Procedure for Extentions](https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=68792) [^11]
- [Mitigating Circumstances Procedure](https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=23163) [^13]
- [Policy on Mitigating Circumstances and Coursework Extensions](https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=4271) [^14]
- [A Basic Guide to Mitigating Circumstances](https://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=23886) [^15]

#### Extentions
Extentions are usually offered for up to 5 working days, without the requirement for evidence. Longer extentions can be granted at the schools discretion. [^12]
